# Getting Started

---

#### Layout of R Studio

Clockwise from top left: Console (where your code is executed), Source (where you write code and view raw data), File/plot/package/help/viewer pane; environment/history pane (least useful, you can just minimize)
---
# Terms
* **projects** - a way for R to bundle all your different codes together in a single working directory (aka folder).  ALWAYS USE THESE!!
* **packages** - different open source plug-ins that allow you to do different things, like import the icd-10 groupings (icd.data), conduct survival analyses (survival, survminer), play a chime (or the mario theme song) when your code finishes (beepr), animate figures(gganimate) or make emojis plot points on your graphs (emoGG)
* **tidyverse** - a set of packages that works off of the principles around tidy data
* **pipe** - %>% <- this thing right here, basically means "take what you just did, and then do this." Used widely in the tidyverse
* **object** - a thing you create in R. It can be a list of things, a dataset, an image, a variable, a number, anything
* **assignment operator** - <- this arrow shaped thing, it's how you define an object
* **data frame** - r's fancy name for a table
* **tibble** - a fancy name for a data frame within the tidyverse. 
* **$** - used to separate a dataframe and variable. eg if I just want one variable from a dataset, I would type dataset$variable

Hear me use another term that you don't understand? Please stop me and ask :)
---

# Finding Help

* **?function** - by placing a question mark before any function, you'll get all of the help documentation associated with that function
* **vignettes** - really nice extended examples that some packages have for certain functions.  Allows you to see a practical application of the code. I often google the function name + vignette (or package name + vignette)
* **cheat sheets** - they exist for certain packages. Go to help>cheatsheets in rstudio, or [this link](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

* **google**, **twitter**(#rstats), and **stackoverflow**(not for the faint of heart)

---
# Coding Etiquette

* Comment your code frequently and thoroughly (# denotes a comment in R. and R Studio lets you quickly reflow comments into multiple lines - code > reflow comment)
* Link it to Jira tickets and/or provide a background on what the request is
* Load your libraries all at once at beginning of code
* Place raw data in a "rawdata" folder, and NEVER OVERWRITE THAT DATA
* One pipe per line
* Use naming conventions that you can decipher months later (ie not t1, t2, t3, t4)
  
#### How do I know if my code is legible?
* Can someone else read it right now and follow along easily?
* Can you read it in 3 months and quickly figure out what you did?
* Ugh this sounds like an annoying amount of work
  * there are packages, like styler, that can style your code for you after the fact. 

* Want more coding style tips? Check out the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

---

# Creating a new project

* Create a folder somewhere on your system for this project (Get in the habit of making a new folder for every R project you work on)
* Inside that folder, create a subfolder called "RawData"
* Open R Studio
* File > New Project > Existing Directory - navigate to the directory you just created

Congrats! You just made a project! 

---

# Installing our packages
* Let's open an R script first: File > New File > New R Script
* We're going to install 4 packages: tidyverse, tidylog, skimr, and visdat - these 4 are a good starting point for many projects

```{r, eval = F}
#Installing packages with install.packages command

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidylog")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("visdat")

# Now load the libraries for this R script - you only need to install 
# them once, but every time you write a script, you need to load 
# the libraries into your workspace

library(tidyverse) 
library(tidylog)
library(skimr)
library(visdat)
#note I don't need quotation marks here, but you can add them if you want
```


* After you write the code, highlight the code and hit control + enter

# You just installed some packages!

---
# Importing data

Let's get that data into R, shall we?

* Add the course data file to your raw data file
* To get it into R, you'll need to read it and assign it to an object you can use later.

```{r eval = F}
#Reading in the data using readr, which is part of tidyverse
RawRamen <- readr::read_csv("RawData/RamenRatings.csv") 
#you could also write RawRamen <- read_csv("RawData/RamenRatings.csv")

# Not Working? Did you change your file name? is your folder 
# named RawData? R is case sensitive

```

* What about other file formats? For now, it's easiest to save your xlsx sheet as CSV.  You can save from SQL directly to CSV.  If you are intent on reading in excel files as is, check out the readxl package
---

# Checking out the data

There are a number of different commands you can use to check out the data you just imported:

base R ways:
* **str()** - lets you see the variable name, the data type, and the first few entries
* **summary()** - computes summary statistics for all your variables
* **head()** - lets you view the top 6 rows of your data (can change the n rows)

My preferences:
* **skimr::skim()** - gives a really nice summary of all your data, including tiny histograms where applicable, organized by data type (small issue with this)
* **visdat::vis_dat()** gives you a quick figure by variable type while also highlighting missing data points
* **visdat::vis_mis()** focuses on missing data points
* **View()** - lets you view the data in a separate tab, like a spreadsheet

---
#Practice 1 
Take a few minutes and use each of these commands on your dataset, RawRamen 

Check out how all these commands change when we clean our data a bit and convert variables to more appropriate types. Try rerunning the same commands with the CleanRamen data, defined below
```{r eval = F}
CleanRamen <- RawRamen %>% 
  mutate(stars = as.numeric(stars),
         style = factor(style),
         brand = factor(brand),
         country = factor(country))
```

* Note that if you resize your console window, you'll get different output layouts for skim()

# Congrats! You have data AND you've started exploring it!!

---

# Quick word on variable types

* You should see several different variable types when you look at your data.
* One worth noting: Factors
  * These are what we use for categorical variables (can be ordered or unordered)
  * This type eliminates the need for dummy variables in most statistical models
* To change a variable's datatype, we can use as.[newvariabletype]

---
# Example

```{r factors, eval = F}

str(mtcars) 
#note cylinders is numeric, but we can probably treat it as categorical

mtcars$cyl2 <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
str(mtcars) 

#Want to make it numeric again?
mtcars$cyl3 <- as.numeric(mtcars$cyl)
str(mtcars) 

#WHAT HAPPENED?!
#factors have both a numerical code, and a category label. 
#On the backend, r sees levels 1, 2, and 3 with the following character labels:
levels(mtcars$cyl2)

#So to convert back, you have to get a little tricky - first convert to string, then numeric
mtcars$cyl4 <- as.numeric(as.character(mtcars$cyl))
str(mtcars$cyl) #original
str(mtcars$cyl2) # as factor
str(mtcars$cyl3) #from factor straight to numeric
str(mtcars$cyl4) #from factor to string to numeric

```

---

# Manipulating data
* We're going to keep it simple, and focus on the 5 dplyr verbs you will use most often
  * **select()**
  * **filter()**
  * **mutate()**
  * **summarize()** (with **group_by()**)
  * **arrange()**

* Need to pivot stuff and go between long and wide data formats? It's outside the scope of today's course, but check out **gather()** & **spread()** (older tidyr functions) or **pivot_longer()** & **pivot_wider()** (new tidyr functions)

---
# First, our logical operators

* **>=, >, <, <=** - all what you expect
* **==** - we use a double equals for equals in R
* **&** - and
* **|** - or
* **ifelse()** - works like if() in excel; ifelse(logical statement, output if T, output if F)
* **T, TRUE, F, FALSE** - all acceptable logical outputs

---

# Select and Filter

Let's start with our dataframe RawRamen.  

Say we want to select all columns other than review_number, and we want to filter to only styles served in cups or bowls

```{r select n filter, eval = F}

RawRamen %>% #this means take our data frame and then do the next line
  select(-review_number) %>% 
  filter(style == "Cup" | style == "Bowl") #| means 'or';

#R is flexible, and there are multiple ways to do the same things
RawRamen %>% 
  select(brand, variety, style, country, stars) %>% 
  filter(style %in% c("Cup", "Bowl")) #c() is just how we make lists of items. Don't forget quotes!

```

---

# Mutate
* Mutate is super useful for two things:
  * calculating new variables based on existing variables
  * altering the variable type of an existing variable

Let's calculate a column that converts the stars to a percent (max stars = 5),
and let's convert style and brand to factors.
```{r, eval = F}
RawRamen %>% 
  mutate(stars = as.numeric(stars), #need to convert stars first
         rating_perc = round( stars/5 * 100,2),
         style = as.factor(style),
         brand = as.factor(brand))
```

---
# Summarize & Arrange (and group_by)

What brands have the highest average scores?
* In this case, we want to group our data by the brand, and then summarize by average scores.
* Arrange will then help us sort them in order

```{r}
RawRamen %>% 
  mutate(stars = as.numeric(stars)) %>% #still need to make stars numeric first
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  summarize(AvgStars = mean(stars, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(AvgStars))
```

---
# Bonus Functions
* Some quick bonus functions that can be helpful early on
  * **is.na()** - returns a logical (T/F), useful for subsetting and conditional statements
  * **rename()** - another verb, useful for renaming variables with annoying names, or to make them more reader friendly just before you print
  * **tally()** - a shortcut for summarize(n), gives you a count of all items by your previous grouping variables
  * **distinct()** - pulls out distinct values

---
# PRACTICE 2
.pull-left[
* How many reviews have a rating of <= 1?

* How many reviews are there for the US

* Create a column for "Good ramen", which flags ramen >= 4 as "good", and all others as "mediocre".  How many reviews are good vs mediocre?

* What country has the most reviews, and what's the average review by country? (**n()** will give you count of rows)

* Bonus: How many different styles of ramen are there?

# The grammar of graphics
* You'll hear this a lot in R crowds, and it's what the gg stands for in ggplot2
* What you need to know:
  * The Grammar of Graphics is the idea that you can build every graph from the same basic components (or layers)
      * Data
      * Geoms
      * Coordinate system
* How this looks in ggplot
  * You select your dataset, identify your aesthetics (tell ggplot how to use your data), and then select your geoms (what type of graph do you want? Bar? Line? Bubble? Boxplot?)  
  * Most of the time, this is enough.  The rest is just making it pretty

#Practice 3
* Go back to our third visual, where we make it fancy (slide 33)
  * Change "color" to "fill" in aes()
  * Now replace geom_point with geom_col(). What happens?
  * What happens if you use geom_bar()? try geom_bar(stat = "identity")


* Create a visual that explores how ramen ratings vary by style (you'll need to manipulate RawRamen first)
  * Try different ways to visualize the different styles (color, fill, facet_wrap, different geoms, etc)

# Rmarkdown

* A type of file that allows you to integrate text, html, r code, and several other languages into a single document
*  That document also references your data file and relevant packages, so everything is in one place.
* Various options for output, including slides, dynamic html reports, pdfs, and even word docs.

* create rscript 
* do my analysis in that script 
* figure out what I want to report out
* create an rmarkdown document, and use relevant portions of code from rscript file
* knit the file to pdf
